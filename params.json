Coupled with a powerful 60 MHz 32-bit processor and a simple scripting language anyone is able to craft payloads capable of changing system settings, opening back doors, retrieving data, initiating reverse shells, or basically anything that can be achieved with physical access -- all automated and executed in a matter of seconds.\r\n\r\n* Cross-Platform: Attacks any OS that supports USB Keyboards\r\n* Simple Scripting language: Start writing payloads in minutes\r\n* Open Source Firmware: Add functionality using included libraries\r\n* Expandable Storage: Micro SD cards make it possible to carry multiple payloads\r\n* Community Support: Share sample scripts, complete payloads and get help online\r\n","google":"UA-28180306-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
